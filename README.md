# CSE237 - My Friend Dragon
By: Julia Smith, Katrina Ragbeer, Matthew Alexander, and Shahd Alyasiry

### Iteration 1
During this iteration, we completed 6 stories. These stories included a functional UI of our game with a bit of backend support.
This included modification of the dragon's needs when it is fed or pet, aging-up the dragon when it's needs are fully met, and 
including animations for when the dragon is interacted with. We also wrote tests for the functionality that we added and cleaned
up our code per the Clean Code guidelines.

For the next iteration, we plan to have visible food and love meters so the user knows how much more the dragon needs. We also
intend to begin coding the minigames that reward the user with food to feed the dragon. The minigames should give the user a 
score, and the user is awarded an amount of food based on the score they received. We also want the user to be able to see how 
much food they have accumulated. Finally, we want to have some sort of visual indication that the dragon has reached its final
form (an animation).

Currently, everything that we have implemented works as intended. The only thing that doesn't work is the minigame tab, but we
plan to implement that during iteration 2.
